GO Bindings for Csound6
========

This wrapper is still very experimental. It has been tested only on Linux.
It needs a proper installation of Csound6 with header files in the include path in the csound directory
(e.g. csound/csound.h). libcsound64 and libcsnd6 have to be in the PATH.

You can install this package with `go get`:

  `go get github.com/fggp/go-csnd6`
